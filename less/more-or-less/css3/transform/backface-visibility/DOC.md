The CSS backface-visibility property determines whether or not the back face of the element is visible when facing the user. The back face of an element always is a transparent background, letting, when visible, a mirror image of the front face be displayed.

There are cases when we do not want the front face of an element to be visible through the back face, like when doing a flipping card effect (setting two elements side-to-side).

This property has no effect on 2D transforms as there is no perspective.
