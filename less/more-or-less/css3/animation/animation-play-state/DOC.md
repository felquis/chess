The animation-play-state CSS property determines whether an animation is running or paused. You can query this property's value to determine whether or not the animation is currently running; in addition, you can set its value to pause and resume playback of an animation.

Resuming a paused animation will start the animation from where it left off at the time it was paused, rather than starting over from the beginning of the animation sequence.
