The animation CSS property is a shorthand property for animation-name, animation-duration, animation-timing-function, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-direction and animation-fill-mode.

A list of CSS properties that can be animated is available; it's worth noting that these are the same properties supported by CSS transitions.
