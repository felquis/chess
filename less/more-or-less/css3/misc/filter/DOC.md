The CSS filter property provides for effects like blurring or color shifting on an elementâ€™s rendering before the element is displayed. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of an image, a background, or a border.

Included in the CSS standard are several functions that achieve predefined effects. You can also reference a filter specified in SVG with a URL to an SVG filter element.
